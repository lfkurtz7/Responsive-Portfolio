            <section id="main-content1">Hi, I'm Leah! I am a 23 year old greater Philadelphia area native who recently graduated
                from Penn State. I have a Bachelor's degree in Media Studies, and have a strong passion for Media
                Effects. The communications field has long been my confort zone, which is why I'm branching out in hopes
                to discover something new. I am certainly passionate about technology and computer science, though I
                have a lot to learn.
                </section>

            <section id="main-content2">When I'm not working or studying, I'm probably out to lunch, playing with my french
                bulldogs, or running in the Wissahickon trails. I also spend a lot of my time with my siblings, who both
                live in Philadelphia as well.
